| Session 1: | Faust Overview and Language Basics | Related Coursework: Intro Survey (Stanford) , Breath-Controlled Polyphonic Synthesizer , Polyphonic Synthesizer | Media: 10 Video Files: 00:29:40 | This session gives an overview of the Faust ecosystem and of its various features. Simple high-level programming examples are provided towards making audio plug-ins, mobile and web apps, and externals for PureData and Max/MSP. It also begins a detailed survey of the Faust language that will be continued in Session 2. |

Its goal is to present a detailed description of Faust’s semantics through a series of examples. In particular students will learn how to code any visual block diagram in Faust, and express the corresponding mathematical semantics. By the end of this lecture, students should be aware of all the syntactical ... |

The goal of this session is to implement various sound synthesis techniques (e.g., AM, FM, subtractive, sampling, basic physical modeling, granular) from scratch in Faust. A strong emphasis will be given to making “finished products,” (advanced user interfaces, polyphony and MIDI compatibility, etc.) ready to be converted to some of the platforms presen...
